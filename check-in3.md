1. Do you have data fully in hand and if not, what blockers are you facing?

I currently have all the data I require.

2. Have you done a full EDA on all of your data?

I have done most of the EDA on the contextual data that accompanies the images that I am training on, however it requires cleaning up/formatting. I have not yet done EDA on the image data itself.

3. Have you begun the modeling process? How accurate are your predictions so far?

I have sketched out and implemented one CNN with minimal convolutions and no dropout layers, and my accuracy is above 80%. I plan on modifying this CNN as well as implementing another for a separate classification.

4. What blockers are you facing, including processing power, data acquisition, modeling difficulties, data cleaning, etc.? How can we help you overcome those challenges?

I was having some issues with getting tensorflow to work well with other libraries on my machine, but I am working in Colab and planning on using Keras to save the model, in addition to continuing to troubleshoot my own machine.

5. Have you changed topics since your lightning talk? Since you submitted your Problem Statement and EDA? If so, do you have the necessary data in hand (and the requisite EDA completed) to continue moving forward?

I have settled on a project for classifying characteristics of honey bees based on image data. I have expanded my problem statement a bit to include additional classifications, but I do not require more data for this.

6. What is your timeline for the rest of the week? What do you _have_ to get done versus what would you _like_ to get done?  

I am planning on wrapping up modeling in the next couple days and spending the rest of time working on Streamlit. I am prioritizing getting the CNNs to over 90% accuracy so that I have proper models before I fully dive into streamlit.
